    <p> <h2>Description</h2>
    </p>
    <p>
        <p><strong>Pizza</strong>is an Italian dish typically consisting of a flat base of leavened wheat-based dough topped with tomato, cheese, and other ingredients, baked at a high temperature, traditionally in a wood-fired oven.</p>

        <p>The term <em>pizza</em> was first recorded in the year 997 AD, in a Latin manuscript from the southern Italian town of Gaeta, in Lazio, on the border with Campania. <i>Raffaele Esposito</i> is often credited for creating modern pizza in Naples.</p>

        <h2>
            Steps
        </h2>
    </p>
    
    <p>
        <ol>
            <li>Mince 2 cloves garlic. Finely grate 1 1/4 ounces Parmesan cheese (about 1/2 cup). Melt 1/2 tablespoon unsalted butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Add the garlic and a pinch of red pepper flakes and cook, stirring a few times, until fragrant and lightly browned, 30 seconds to 1 minute.</li>
            <li>Add 1 1/2 cups heavy cream and whisk until combined. Bring to a simmer and cook until the sauce is reduced by half and thick enough to coat the back of a spoon, 7 to 12 minutes. Add the Parmesan and whisk to combine. Taste and season with kosher salt and black pepper as needed. (You should have 1 cup sauce). Remove from the heat and let cool slightly while preparing the toppings and dough.</li>
            <li>Thinly slice 12 ounces cooked chicken breasts (about 2 cups). Finely chop 1/2 small bunch fresh chives until you have 1 teaspoon. Grate 6 ounces mozzarella cheese on the large holes of a box grater (about 1 1/2 cups).</li>
            <li>Divide dough in half and keep one piece covered. Place one piece on a lightly floured sheet of parchment paper. Roll out into a 10-inch round. If the dough springs back, cover with a towel or plastic wrap and let rest for 10 minutes, then try again.</li>
            <li>Spoon half of the sauce (about 1/2 cup) onto the dough and use the back of a spoon or an offset spatula to spread it into an even layer, leaving a 1/2-inch border. Arrange half of the chicken on the sauce and sprinkle with half the mozzarella (3/4 cup).</li>
            <li>Using the parchment, slide the pizza onto a baking sheet. Bake until the crust and cheese are golden-brown, 15 to 20 minutes. Meanwhile, prepare the second pizza.</li>
            <li>When both pizzas are baked, sprinkle with the chives and more red pepper flakes if desired before slicing and serving.</li>
        </ol>
