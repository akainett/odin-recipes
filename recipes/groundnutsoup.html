        <h2>Description</h2>
    </p>
    <p>
        <p><strong>Groundnut soup</strong> is a popular kind of Ghanaian soup made from, as the name reveals, groundnuts. Depending on where in the world you are, you may either call them groundnuts or peanuts. Groundnut soup is deeply comforting and can be made with a variety of proteins.
            Groundnut soup is sometimes called peanut butter soup, however, locally it has always been groundnut soup. In some local languages, it is known as <i>Azi Detsi</i> (Ewe), <i>Gige Honyu</i> (Ada), or <i>Nkatenkwan</i> (Twi).</p>
        <p>
            Groundnut soup has several variations, usually depending on the protein used just like okro soup can have various ways of preparation.

            <li>Take out the tomatoes and scotch bonnets from the soup and blend until smooth.</li>
