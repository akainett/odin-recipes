    <p><h2>Description</h2>
    </p>
        <p>
        <strong>Jollof or jollof rice</strong>, is a rice dish from West Africa. The dish is typically made with long-grain rice, tomatoes, chilies, onions, spices, and sometimes other vegetables and/or meat in a single pot, although its ingredients and preparation methods vary across different regions. The dish's origins are traced to Senegal.
        
        <p>Regional variations are a source of competition among the countries of West Africa, and in particular between Nigeria and Ghana, over whose version is the best; in the 2010s this developed into a friendly rivalry known as the <i>"Jollof Wars"</i>.</p>
        <p>In French-speaking West Africa, a variation of the dish is known as <em>riz au gras</em>. The Senegalese version, thieboudienne, has been recognized by <b>UNESCO</b> as an intangible cultural heritage dish.</p>
