    <p><h2>Description</h2>
    </p>
        <p>
        <strong>Jollof or jollof rice</strong>, is a rice dish from West Africa. The dish is typically made with long-grain rice, tomatoes, chilies, onions, spices, and sometimes other vegetables and/or meat in a single pot, although its ingredients and preparation methods vary across different regions. The dish's origins are traced to Senegal.
        
        <p>Regional variations are a source of competition among the countries of West Africa, and in particular between Nigeria and Ghana, over whose version is the best; in the 2010s this developed into a friendly rivalry known as the <i>"Jollof Wars"</i>.</p>
        <p>In French-speaking West Africa, a variation of the dish is known as <em>riz au gras</em>. The Senegalese version, thieboudienne, has been recognized by <b>UNESCO</b> as an intangible cultural heritage dish.</p>

            Steps
        </h2>
    </p>
    
    <p>
        <ol>
            <li>Add onions and 2 tablespoons of oil to a blender and pulse until smooth. Transfer to a medium bowl.</li>
            <li>Add the diced tomatoes, tomato paste, and habanero pepper to the blender, and pulse until smooth. Transfer to a separate medium bowl.</li>
            <li>Heat the remaining â…“ cup (80 ml) of oil in a large, heavy-bottomed pot over medium heat.</li>
            <li>Once the oil is shimmering, add the onion puree and cook until the water has cooked out and the puree is starting to brown, about 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Stir in the tomato puree and add the curry powder, garlic powder, ginger, dried herbs, and crushed bouillon cubes. Cook for 20-30 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the stew has reduced by half and is deep red in color.</li>
            <li>Add the rice, mixed vegetables, and water. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to low and cover the pot with foil and a lid. Simmer for another 30 minutes, until the rice is cooked through and the liquid is absorbed.</li>
